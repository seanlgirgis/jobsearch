Yes, you can benefit from the $150 monthly free API credits if your app uses the **xAI API** (i.e., making calls to Grok models via api.x.ai).

The program is specifically for xAI API usage, so if your resume/cover letter drafting app routes its AI requests through the xAI/Grok API, the credits will directly reduce (or eliminate) your monthly billing costs up to $150.

### Eligibility Check for You
- **Country**: You are in the US (Plano, Texas), and the US is **eligible**. The ineligible countries are mostly EU/EEA + UK.
- **Other requirements**: Your team must spend at least $5 on the xAI API first, then opt in.

### How to Get the Free Credits
1. **Sign up for the xAI API** (if you haven’t already) at https://console.x.ai.
2. **Add payment method** and start using the API in your app. Make actual billed API calls until you’ve spent **at least $5** (this is the minimum threshold to unlock eligibility).
3. Once you’ve spent $5+, go to the billing/credits page:  
   https://console.x.ai/team/default/billing/credits
4. As the **team admin**, enable data sharing.  
   - This is a one-way decision: once you opt in, the team **cannot opt out**.
   - It applies at the team level (you can create multiple teams if you want some opted in and some not).
5. After opting in, you’ll automatically receive **$150 in free credits every month**.

### Important Notes
- The credits apply only to xAI API usage (Grok model calls). They won’t help if your app is using OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.
- By opting in, you agree to share your API requests (prompts and responses) with xAI for model improvement.
- Credits are issued monthly and can cover typical usage for a resume/cover letter app unless you scale to very high volume.

If your app is already built on a different provider’s API, you’d need to migrate to xAI’s Grok models to take advantage of this. The migration effort varies, but xAI’s API is compatible with OpenAI-style endpoints, so it’s often straightforward.
