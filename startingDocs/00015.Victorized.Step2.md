### Great – Index Build Succeeded!

The output you shared shows **everything worked perfectly** for your 16 jobs:

- Found 16 job folders
- Collected 16 valid descriptions (no skips – good fallback logic)
- Downloaded and loaded the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model (~90MB, one-time)
- Embedded all 16 descriptions (dim 384)
- Created and saved the FAISS index (24KB – tiny!)
- Saved the metadata YAML
- Final success message

You're now fully set up with a semantic index of your past jobs.

#### Quick Summary of What This Means
- You have a **RAG-ready data store** for job descriptions.
- The next script (`00_check_applied_before.py`) can now query this index for duplicates.
- The build script is production-grade: type-hinted, well-documented, error-handled, and follows the project's coding standards.

#### Minor Notes from Output (Non-Issues)
1. **Hugging Face Unauthenticated Warning**  
   → Normal for first run. You can ignore it or set a free Hugging Face token for faster downloads (optional):  
   ```bash
   # In PowerShell
   $env:HF_TOKEN = "hf_YourTokenHere"
   ```
   Or disable symlink warning permanently:
   ```bash
   $env:HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING = "1"
   ```

2. **Symlink Warning on Windows**  
   → Common on Windows (your cache path: `C:\Users\shareuser\.cache\huggingface`).  
   Options (pick one):  
   - Run as admin (temporary)  
   - Enable Developer Mode (recommended for long-term Windows dev) → https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development  
   - Ignore – it just uses more disk space (still works fine)

3. **Model Download**  
   → Only happens once. Future runs will be instant (model is cached).

#### Next Steps – Let's Integrate & Test

1. **Add to requirements.txt**  
   Append these lines (if not already done):
   ```txt
   faiss-cpu>=1.8.0
   sentence-transformers>=2.2.2
   numpy>=1.23.0
   pyyaml>=6.0
   ```

2. **Update .gitignore** (recommended)  
   Add:
   ```
   data/job_index/*.index
   # ^ Only the binary index – keep metadata.yaml versioned
   ```

3. **Test the Duplicate Checker**  
   Now that the index exists, let's create/test the `00_check_applied_before.py` script.

   **Proposed Action**: I'll provide the full, polished version of `scripts/00_check_applied_before.py` in the next response (strict typing, full docs, argparse, etc., similar style to `build_job_index.py`).  
   It will:
   - Load the index + metadata we just created
   - Take an intake .md file as input
   - Embed it
   - Query FAISS for top matches
   - Show table with UUID, company, role, date, similarity %
   - Exit 1 if any match ≥ threshold (default 0.82)

   **Test Command Example**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/00_check_applied_before.py intake/your_new_job.md --threshold 0.85
   ```

   Or, to test with a known similar job (copy one existing raw .md to `intake/test_duplicate.md`):
   ```bash
   python scripts/00_check_applied_before.py intake/test_duplicate.md
   ```

4. **Pipeline Integration**  
   Once the 00 script works, we can add it as a pre-check in `10_auto_pipeline.py`:
   - Run 00 first
   - If exit code 1 → stop and warn user
   - Else → proceed

   Also add incremental index update at the end of 10 (call `build_job_index.py` with `--incremental` flag in v1).

#### Decisions Log Update (for decisions.md)
Add this entry:
```
- **2026-02-06 – Job Index Built Successfully**: Ran `scripts/utils/build_job_index.py --rebuild` and successfully indexed 16 past job descriptions. FAISS index and metadata ready for RAG duplicate checks.
```

Let me know:
- Ready for the full `00_check_applied_before.py` code now?
- Want any tweaks to the build script first (e.g., add `--incremental` support)?
- Prefer to test the index manually with a quick query script first?

We're making solid progress toward the full RAG layer! 🚀
