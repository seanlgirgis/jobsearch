Great — thank you for taking care of that quickly.

The three master files are now in place under `data/master/`:

- `master_profile.md` (primary human-editable version)
- `master_career_data.json` (structured full career snapshot)
- `skills.json` (granular, queryable skills list with metadata)

And you've logged the decision in `.grok/decisions.md` so future interactions (including with me) have clear memory of this architecture choice.

This is a solid foundation. From now on, when we generate tailored resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn summaries, job-match analyses, skill-gap reports, or anything persona-based, we can treat these three files as the **single source of truth** for your background.

### Quick next-level checklist (what we can do now that the masters exist)

Pick whichever feels most useful right now — or tell me your priority:

1. **Basic validation / ingestion test**  
   Write a small Python snippet (that you can run locally or we can test here) to:
   - Load `master_profile.md` (markdown → text chunks)
   - Load & parse the two JSON files
   - Print a sample structured output (e.g. list all experience bullets, top 10 skills with years)

2. **First real usage — generate a tailored resume**  
   You paste (or link) a real job description → I pull relevant bullets/projects/skills from the masters → output a customized 1–2 page resume in markdown (ready to convert to PDF/Word).

3. **Cover letter prototype**  
   Same idea: feed me a job posting → I generate a full, personalized cover letter pulling strongest matches from your masters.

4. **Skills enrichment / auto-tagging**  
   Expand `skills.json` with more entries (e.g. add Streamlit, Docker, Airflow, Dynatrace, Perl/Ksh, C++/OCCI etc. with rough years/proficiency). We can do a quick pass together.

5. **Job search data store kick-off**  
   Start building the other side of the RAG → e.g. create `data/jobs/` folder with schema for scraped/saved postings (title, company, url, description text, date_saved, match_score later, etc.)

6. **RAG architecture sketch**  
   Outline folder structure + tools/libraries we plan to use (e.g. LangChain / LlamaIndex / Haystack / pure embeddings with sentence-transformers + FAISS / Chroma / Qdrant).

7. **Website sync / update ideas**  
   Since your GitHub Pages site already pulls from `resume.md` / `cv.md`, discuss how to keep it in sync with the new `master_profile.md` (e.g. symlink, CI script, or just manual copy for now).

What would you like to tackle first?  
(If you're not sure, I'd suggest starting with #2 — find one interesting job posting and let's produce your first tailored resume using the new masters. That will immediately validate the whole flow.)
