Great — let's proceed with **step 1: Basic validation / ingestion test**.

Since the actual files (`master_profile.md`, `master_career_data.json`, `skills.json`) don't appear to be committed/pushed to the public repo yet (404s on raw URLs + nothing visible in tree), we'll write the snippet assuming:

- The files live locally in your project under `data/master/` (as per the plan in `00007.stepsToFollow.md`)
- You have already created/populated them manually or from earlier conversations

Here's a clean, small Python script you can save as e.g. `test_ingestion.py` and run locally.

It uses only standard library + `markdown` (for basic section splitting) and `json` — no heavy dependencies yet.

```python
# test_ingestion.py
from pathlib import Path
import json
import re
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

# Adjust base path if needed
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent  # assuming script is in src/ or notebooks/
DATA_DIR = BASE_DIR / "data" / "master"

MASTER_MD   = DATA_DIR / "master_profile.md"
CAREER_JSON = DATA_DIR / "master_career_data.json"
SKILLS_JSON = DATA_DIR / "skills.json"


def load_markdown_chunks(path: Path, min_length: int = 40) -> List[str]:
    """Very simple markdown → text chunks by headers + content blocks"""
    if not path.is_file():
        print(f"File not found: {path}")
        return []

    text = path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    # Split on h1/h2/h3 headers (common resume sections)
    chunks = re.split(r'(^#{1,3}\s+.+?$)', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    
    result = []
    current = ""
    for part in chunks:
        if part.strip().startswith("#"):
            if current.strip() and len(current.strip()) >= min_length:
                result.append(current.strip())
            current = part.strip()
        else:
            current += "\n" + part.strip()
    
    if current.strip() and len(current.strip()) >= min_length:
        result.append(current.strip())
    
    return result


def extract_experience_bullets(chunks: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    """Naive extraction: look for chunk that looks like Experience section"""
    for chunk in chunks:
        if "experience" in chunk.lower() or "professional" in chunk.lower():
            lines = chunk.splitlines()
            bullets = [line.strip() for line in lines if line.strip().startswith(("- ", "* ", "• "))]
            if bullets:
                return bullets
    return []


def print_sample_experience(bullets: List[str]):
    print("\n=== Sample Experience Bullets (first 8) ===")
    for i, bullet in enumerate(bullets[:8], 1):
        print(f"{i}. {bullet}")
    if len(bullets) > 8:
        print(f"... ({len(bullets)-8} more)")


def print_top_skills(skills_data: List[Dict], top_n: int = 10):
    """Assuming skills.json is list of dicts like [{"name": "Python", "years": 8, ...}, ...]"""
    print(f"\n=== Top {top_n} Skills by Years of Experience ===")
    
    sorted_skills = sorted(
        (s for s in skills_data if isinstance(s.get("years"), (int, float))),
        key=lambda s: s.get("years", 0),
        reverse=True
    )
    
    for i, skill in enumerate(sorted_skills[:top_n], 1):
        name = skill.get("name", "???")
        years = skill.get("years", "?")
        level = skill.get("proficiency", "").strip()  # optional
        extra = f" ({level})" if level else ""
        print(f"{i:2d}. {name:<22} {years:>3} years{extra}")


def main():
    print("=== Basic Master Files Ingestion Test ===\n")
    
    # 1. Markdown profile
    chunks = load_markdown_chunks(MASTER_MD)
    print(f"Loaded master_profile.md → {len(chunks)} meaningful chunks")
    
    bullets = extract_experience_bullets(chunks)
    print(f"Found {len(bullets)} experience bullet points")
    print_sample_experience(bullets)
    
    # 2. Career JSON
    try:
        with CAREER_JSON.open(encoding="utf-8") as f:
            career = json.load(f)
        print(f"Loaded master_career_data.json → type: {type(career).__name__}, keys/len: {list(career.keys()) if isinstance(career, dict) else len(career)}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading career JSON: {e}")
        career = {}

### How to use / test

1. Save as `test_ingestion.py` (anywhere convenient, e.g. in root or `src/`)
2. Adjust `BASE_DIR` / `DATA_DIR` if your folder structure is different
3. Make sure the three files exist in `data/master/` with some content
4. Run: `python test_ingestion.py`

Expected output shape (example):

```
=== Basic Master Files Ingestion Test ===

Loaded master_profile.md → 7 meaningful chunks
Found 18 experience bullet points

=== Sample Experience Bullets (first 8) ===
1. - Led development of ...
2. * Optimized ETL pipelines ...
...

Loaded master_career_data.json → type: dict, keys/len: ['education', 'certifications', 'projects', 'experience']
Loaded skills.json → 42 entries

=== Top 10 Skills by Years of Experience ===
 1. Python                  11 years
 2. SQL                      9 years
 3. Data Warehousing         8 years
...
```

Once you run it and share any errors / output / file structure surprises, we can refine parsing (especially markdown section extraction — right now it's very basic).

Next logical moves after this works:
- Improve markdown parsing (maybe use `markdown-it-py` or `frontmatter` if you want sections as dict)
- Start building a small loader class we’ll reuse in the real RAG pipeline
- Or jump straight to #2 — feed a job posting and generate first tailored resume

Let me know what the script outputs or if you want tweaks before running!
