Hello back! 👋 Welcome back, hope the eye break helped.

We're in a solid spot with the ingestion pipeline — YAML files loading cleanly, full career history + 30 skills parsed, bullets extracted, everything structured and ready to query.

Since you mentioned incorporating the xAI key / Grok API capabilities when you returned, let's get that rolling.

### Quick status check & next step options

From the last run:
- Career YAML: 11 experience entries, 3 flagship projects
- Skills: 30 entries, top ones sorted sensibly
- Markdown fallback: pulling 20 bullets (mixed but usable)

To add AI-powered features (tailoring, rephrasing, keyword optimization, summary generation, etc.), we need to hook up the xAI API.

**What do you have ready right now?** Pick whichever applies or mix:

1. **Do you already have an xAI API key?**  
   - Yes → great, let's integrate it (tell me how you're storing it: env var, .env file, hard-coded for testing only, etc.)  
   - Not yet → I can guide you to where to get one (console.x.ai or similar in 2026) or we can plan the code structure first and plug the key later.

2. **Preferred first AI-powered feature?**  
   (We can start small — one function that uses Grok to enhance something specific)

   - Generate a tailored professional summary for a specific job
   - Rephrase / re-order / keyword-optimize experience bullets
   - Create a custom cover letter paragraph opener
   - Extract & rank job requirements keywords against your skills
   - Suggest which flagship projects to highlight (with reasoning)
   - Something else?

3. **Job description to test with?**  
   If you have one ready (even a rough paste from LinkedIn/Indeed/company site), drop it now — we can use it as the first real test case once the API is wired.

### Minimal starter code snippet (API integration preview)

Once you confirm the key setup, we can drop something like this into a new file (e.g. `src/ai_tailor.py`):

```python
# src/ai_tailor.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from xai import GrokClient  # adjust to actual import name in 2026

load_dotenv()

class GrokTailor:
    def __init__(self):
        api_key = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
        if not api_key:
            raise ValueError("XAI_API_KEY not found in environment")
        self.client = GrokClient(api_key=api_key)  # or whatever the client class is

    def generate_tailored_section(
        self,
        section_type: str,          # e.g. "summary", "bullets", "cover_letter"
        job_description: str,
        master_data: dict,          # from MasterProfile.career or .skills
        max_tokens: int = 400,
        temperature: float = 0.5
    ) -> str:
        # Build prompt dynamically based on section_type
        prompt = self._build_prompt(section_type, job_description, master_data)
        
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="grok-4",  # or latest best model
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=temperature,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content.strip()

    def _build_prompt(self, section_type, job_desc, master_data):
        # Example for summary — we'll expand for other types
        if section_type == "summary":
            return f"""
You are an expert ATS-optimized resume writer.
Using this master career data:
{self._summarize_master(master_data)}

And this job description:
{job_desc}

Write a 4-6 line professional summary that:
- Leads with strongest matching title/expertise
- Incorporates exact keywords from the job
- Quantifies achievements where possible
- Sounds natural and confident
"""
        # Add cases for "experience_bullets", "cover_letter", etc.
        raise NotImplementedError(f"Section {section_type} not implemented yet")

    def _summarize_master(self, data):
        # Simple string summary of relevant parts — expand as needed
        return f"Name: {data.get('personal', {}).get('name')}\nExperience: {len(data.get('experience', []))} roles\nSkills: top ones include Python 15y, SQL/Oracle 18y, AWS, PySpark, GenAI..."

# Usage example:
# tailor = GrokTailor()
# tailored_summary = tailor.generate_tailored_section("summary", job_text, profile.career)
```

Just let me know:
- Key status
- Which feature to build first
- Any job desc ready to test

We'll iterate from there — code stays public in the repo as planned. Ready when you are! 🚀
