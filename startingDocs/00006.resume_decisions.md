Yes, focusing on **MD** and **DOCX** as primary output formats makes a lot of sense right now—it's pragmatic, reduces complexity, and aligns perfectly with both the RAG customization needs and the clean, text-first style of your current website/resume.

### Why MD + DOCX is a strong starting point
- **Markdown (.md)**  
  - Matches the source format you already use (`resume.md`, `cv.md`).  
  - Easy to version-control, diff, and store in the jobsearch repo.  
  - Ideal for RAG: We can treat the generated MD as structured text, chunk it, embed it, or feed sections directly into models for further tailoring.  
  - Quick preview: Renders beautifully on GitHub, GitHub Pages, or any Markdown viewer.  
  - Conversion to PDF is trivial later (Pandoc, markdown-pdf, or even browser print → PDF) if needed for submission.

- **DOCX (.docx)**  
  - The de-facto standard for most ATS systems and recruiters who want an editable Word file.  
  - Allows precise control over formatting (fonts, margins, tables for skills matrix, etc.) to mimic your website's clean look without reinventing PDF rendering headaches.  
  - Libraries like `python-docx` are lightweight, pure-Python, and give us full programmatic control—no external binaries like LibreOffice or Pandoc required for this format.  
  - Once we have a good DOCX template/style that echoes your site's typography (sans-serif, generous spacing, bold headings, bullet hierarchy), we can reuse it for cover letters too.

- **PDF as secondary / on-demand**  
  - You're right: If the DOCX matches the style closely, users (including you) can just open in Word/LibreOffice and export to PDF with good fidelity.  
  - Or we add a simple Pandoc one-liner later if PDF demand increases—no need to build it into the core generator MVP.

This narrows the scope dramatically compared to the full Behemoth multi-format beast, while preserving what you value most: **the formatting and structure** that makes your resume scannable and professional.

### Proposed MVP for the resume/cover letter generator in jobsearch repo
We'll create a clean, modular component under `src/resume_generator/` (or similar).

1. **Inputs**
   - Base content: `resume_base.md` (your current `resume.md` style/structure copied over).
   - Customization data: JSON/YAML dict from RAG pipeline (e.g., tailored summary, rephrased bullets for a specific job, selected skills).
   - Template/style config: Simple dict or YAML defining fonts, margins, heading styles, etc.

2. **Outputs**
   - `custom_resume.md` — rendered Markdown with updates applied.
   - `custom_resume.docx` — formatted Word doc matching website aesthetic.
   - Same for cover letter: `custom_cover_letter.md` + `.docx`.

3. **Core logic (high-level)**
   - Parse base MD → structured data (sections, bullets, etc.) using markdown-it-py or mistune.
   - Apply RAG-generated changes (e.g., replace summary section, rewrite experience bullets).
   - Render to MD (simple text substitution + cleanup).
   - Render to DOCX using python-docx:
     - Define a style template (e.g., Heading 1 = bold uppercase 18pt, Body = 11pt Calibri/Arial, bullets indented).
     - Map sections: Name at top, contact inline, then Professional Experience → jobs as Heading 2 + bullets, Core Skills as table or bold subheadings.

4. **Style matching to your website**
   From the site:
   - Sans-serif font (Arial / Helvetica fallback).
   - Black on white, high contrast.
   - Uppercase bold headings.
   - Inline contact header.
   - Bullet-point heavy experience descriptions.
   - Skills matrix with categories (we can do as bulleted sub-lists or a simple table in DOCX).
   - Generous whitespace / line breaks.

   We can hardcode these as defaults in a `styles.py` or `template.docx` (pre-styled blank doc that python-docx loads and fills).

### Next concrete steps
1. Copy `resume.md` from seanlgirgis.github.io → jobsearch repo (as `data/base_resume.md` or similar).
2. Create a minimal prototype script in jobsearch:
   - `src/resume_generator/generate.py`
   - Takes `--input-md`, `--output-dir`, `--custom-json` (for RAG tweaks).
   - Outputs MD + DOCX.
3. Commit it publicly, update decisions.md with "MVP: MD + DOCX only, style matched to website, defer PDF".
4. Add a sample cover letter template (simple MD structure: greeting, 3-4 paragraphs, sign-off).
5. In rules.md, add: "Resume/cover generators MUST output MD + DOCX; prioritize ATS-friendly formatting over fancy visuals."

This keeps momentum high, eliminates format sprawl, and sets us up nicely for RAG integration (e.g., next we can pipe job descriptions → model → custom JSON → generator).

What do you think—should we start by copying `resume.md` over and sketching the python-docx style code here, or do you want to prototype something specific first (e.g., cover letter structure)?
