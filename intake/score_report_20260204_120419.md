## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Data Engineering Experience**: With 20+ years in data engineering and roles like Senior Capacity & Data Engineer at CITI, the candidate exceeds the 12+ years of experience required for designing and building data warehouse models.
- **Expertise in SQL and Python**: The job requires strong proficiency in SQL and a programming language like Python. The candidate has 18 years of expert-level SQL experience and 15 years of expert-level Python experience, aligning perfectly with the role’s technical needs.
- **ETL Design & Optimization**: The candidate’s 15 years of expertise in ETL design matches the job’s focus of leading ingestion and transformation pipelines, as well as ELT workflows.
- **Technical Leadership Potential**: While not explicitly a management role, the job requires mentoring and guiding peers. The candidate’s long tenure in senior roles (e.g., Senior Capacity & Data Engineer) suggests capability in technical leadership and influencing peers.
- **Data Warehousing Knowledge**: With 10 years of advanced experience in data warehousing, the candidate is well-equipped to develop and evolve dimensional models (facts and dimensions) as outlined in the job description.
- **Orchestration and Workflow Familiarity**: Although specific tools like Airflow or DBT are not listed in the profile, the candidate’s broad experience in ETL and pipeline optimization (15 years) indicates likely adaptability to orchestration tools and workflows.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Lack of Specific Tool Experience**: The job mentions modern tools like Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Airflow, and DBT, which are not explicitly listed in the candidate’s profile. **Mitigation**: Highlight transferable skills with similar tools (e.g., AWS Glue/Athena, PySpark) and express eagerness to learn specific platforms during the interview.
- **No Mention of Healthcare Domain Knowledge**: While not required, experience in healthcare or regulated data environments is a plus. The candidate’s profile does not indicate exposure to this domain. **Mitigation**: Emphasize adaptability and quick learning from past roles in regulated industries like finance (CITI) to bridge this gap.
- **Limited Recent Focus on Dimensional Modeling**: The candidate’s recent roles focus on capacity planning and serverless architectures (AWS Glue/Athena), which may not directly align with the job’s emphasis on dimensional modeling. **Mitigation**: Highlight past data warehousing experience (10 years) and draw parallels to current skills in data pipeline optimization.
- **Geographic Constraint**: The role requires a hybrid presence in San Francisco, CA, Plano, TX, or Lehi, UT (2 days/week in office). If the candidate is not located near these areas, this could be a barrier. **Mitigation**: Clarify willingness to relocate or negotiate remote flexibility during the application process.

## Advice
Leverage your extensive experience in data engineering and ETL optimization to position yourself as a strong technical leader for this role. Tailor your resume and interview responses to emphasize transferable skills in data warehousing and pipeline design, while addressing tool-specific gaps by showcasing quick adaptability from past tech transitions (e.g., legacy to AWS serverless).
