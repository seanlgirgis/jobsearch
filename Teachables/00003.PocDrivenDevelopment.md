# 00003. PocDrivenDevelopment

## Date Added
2026-02-04 (during pipeline planning)

## Core Explanation
POC-Driven Development: Build throwaway prototypes for key flows before full specs/code. Steps:
1. Pick one scenario (e.g., intake job → match).
2. Hack minimal end-to-end (scripts/snippets, real data).
3. Test/iterate (feedback loops).
4. Extract learnings → design specs → production code.

## Why It Matters Here
Job search RAG has uncertainties (LLM quality, data matching). POC validates fast, avoids bad designs. Fits our public, iterative repo style.
