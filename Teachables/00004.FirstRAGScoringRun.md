# 00004. First RAG Scoring Run (POC Step B)

## Date
2026-02-04

## What Happened
Ran scripts/score_job.py on real intake file → got 85% match report on Collective Health role.
First live example of RAG pattern in project:
- Retrieval: profile summary, top skills, recent roles from YAML
- Augmentation: injected into prompt
- Generation: Grok produced score, recommendation, matches/gaps/advice

## Key Learnings
- CLI scripts give automation & reproducibility (preferred over chat-only)
- Even simple retrieval + prompt engineering gives useful output
- Grok handles reasoning well when given structured data
- Output format (markdown sections) is easy to parse/save later

## Next
- Accept job → UUID + folder structure
- Build tailoring script (Step C)
