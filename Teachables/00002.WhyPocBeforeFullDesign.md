# 00002. Why POC Before Full Design

## Date Added
2026-02-04 (during planning for job tailoring flow)

## Core Explanation
Proof of Concept (POC) is a lightweight, throwaway prototype to test core assumptions before committing to detailed specs or code. In RAG pipelines / AI apps:
- Write minimal code to run one end-to-end scenario (e.g. query → retrieve → generate).
- Use real data (your master_profile.yaml + a job desc).
- Iterate in conversation / notebook until "good enough".
- Then extract patterns → build reusable modules.

Steps:
1. Pick one use-case (e.g. tailor summary for job).
2. Hack it together (no classes yet if possible).
3. Measure (quality, speed, cost).
4. Debrief → specs + clean code.

## Why It Matters Here
Job search RAG has unknowns (prompt quality, chunk relevance, Grok output consistency). POC surfaces them cheap & fast — avoids over-engineering a broken flow. Fits our iterative, public-repo style.
