# 00005. First Automated Job Entry

## Date
2026-02-04

## What Happened
scripts/score_job.py created first persistent job entry in data/jobs/<uuid>/ with:
- raw_intake.md
- score_report.md
- metadata.yaml (status PENDING)

## Key Learnings
- Auto-UUID + folder on first score = good default (no data loss, supports batch)
- Debug prints + try/except blocks catch silent failures fast
- PYTHONPATH + src/ layout works when set correctly

## Next
- Run tailoring script → review YAML → approve → DOCX generation
