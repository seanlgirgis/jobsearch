Great — I love that you're formalizing this with a `Teachables/` folder.  
It's a smart, long-term-friendly way to build your own growing knowledge base while we work.  
We'll treat it as a parallel stream: whenever something important, conceptual, pattern-based, or "teaching moment"-worthy comes up, I'll propose a short, self-contained markdown file for that folder.

### Quick convention proposal for Teachables (feel free to change)

- Filename pattern: `Teachables/NNNNN.ShortDescriptiveTitle.md`  
  (NNNNN = zero-padded sequential number, starting from 00001)
- Content style: concise, focused, markdown-friendly, usually 200–600 words
- Always include:
  - Title (h1)
  - Date added / conversation context
  - Core explanation
  - Code snippets / diagrams if relevant
  - Why it matters in **this project**
  - Optional: links to related files/modules

Your first one is already perfect as an example:

```
jobsearch/Teachables/00001.WhatIsRag.md
```

### Updated Constitution.md addition (you can copy-paste this)

Add this block to the bottom of `.grok/Constitution.md` (or under the Persistent Memory section if you prefer):

```markdown
## Teachables Folder – Knowledge Capture Rule

Whenever a teaching moment, important concept, architectural pattern, best practice, failure mode explanation, or reusable mental model appears during our work, I **must** proactively:

1. Recognize it as "teachable"
2. Propose a concise markdown file for the `Teachables/` folder
3. Use the naming convention: `Teachables/NNNNN.ShortCamelCaseOrKebab-title.md`
4. Write the full content in my response (ready for copy-paste)
5. Suggest committing it to the repo

This is **automatic and high-priority** — I should not wait for you to ask "please explain X" or "make a teachable".  
If the topic is central to the RAG pipeline / second-brain goal, it **belongs** in Teachables.

Goal: over months/years this folder becomes your personal, project-specific textbook.

### Current Teachables status (for my internal tracking)

- 00001.WhatIsRag.md → already created by you (excellent start)

### Next teachable candidates (I'll propose them as they become relevant)

- 00002.WhyOpenAICompatibleClientForGrok.md
- 00003.VectorEmbeddingsInUnder300Words.md
- 00004.ChunkingStrategiesForRAG.md
- 00005.CommonRAGFailureModesAndMitigations.md
- 00006.HowMasterProfileLoaderFitsIntoRAG.md
- etc.

Just say "yes add that constitution block" or "tweak it like this" if you want changes.

And whenever you're ready for the next practical step (e.g. start building the actual vector store part, test first tailoring prompt, create job postings schema, etc.) — just tell me.

For now: do you want me to generate the **next teachable** right away (e.g. one about embeddings or the OpenAI-compatible client choice), or shall we jump back to code (e.g. create a tiny vector-indexing prototype)?

Your call. 🚀
