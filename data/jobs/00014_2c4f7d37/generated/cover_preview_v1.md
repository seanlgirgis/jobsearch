Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Lead AI Data Engineer position at The Hartford. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a passion for innovative AI solutions, I am eager to contribute to your mission of providing financial security through cutting-edge technology.

At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas, ingesting telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints. My expertise in AWS technologies, including Glue, Athena, S3, and Bedrock, enabled me to design a serverless lakehouse platform, integrating structured and unstructured data for enterprise-scale applications. Notably, I developed a Text-to-SQL GenAI agent using Claude 3 Sonnet, aligning with your focus on Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. This experience, combined with my work on data pipelines and cloud technologies, positions me to lead the implementation of AI-driven systems at The Hartford.

Additionally, my recent project, HorizonScale, an AI Capacity Forecasting Engine, replaced legacy processes with a parallel generator-based pipeline using PySpark and Prophet, reducing forecasting cycles by 90%. I also built interactive Streamlit dashboards for real-time insights, demonstrating my ability to ensure scalability and reliability in data systems. With advanced proficiency in SQL, data governance, and big data tools like Spark, I am prepared to develop robust data pipelines and integrate complex data relationships using vector and graph databases, as outlined in your requirements. I am inspired by The Hartford’s commitment to innovation and digital transformation, and I am eager to contribute to your collaborative, customer-focused culture.

I am confident that my extensive experience in data engineering, Generative AI, and cloud technologies will add significant value to The Hartford’s AI initiatives. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your needs. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
