Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Staff Engineer - Capacity Planning and Management position at Geico in Dallas, TX. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and capacity planning, I am eager to contribute to your mission of providing affordable, high-quality insurance through innovative technology solutions.

At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas to ingest telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints, replacing manual processes with efficient forecasting pipelines. I developed machine learning models with Prophet and scikit-learn to predict capacity bottlenecks six months ahead, enhancing infrastructure provisioning accuracy. These efforts directly align with Geico’s need for cloud and OnPrem capacity forecasting, workload analysis, and data-driven infrastructure decisions in hybrid cloud environments.

Additionally, my recent projects include designing a serverless data platform on AWS using Glue, Athena, and S3, optimizing ETL processes for enterprise scale. My HorizonScale AI Capacity Forecasting Engine reduced forecasting cycles by 90% through parallel generator-based pipelines and delivered real-time insights via interactive Streamlit dashboards. These experiences demonstrate my expertise in cloud services like AWS, data analysis, and building tools for capacity signals—key requirements for this role. I am confident in my ability to support Geico’s focus on technological innovation and operational efficiency, as seen in your commitment to digital transformation and data analytics.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my skills in capacity planning, infrastructure engineering, and cloud capacity optimization to Geico. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background can contribute to your team’s success in enhancing the Capacity Management Platform. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of an interview.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
