Role Overview:

We are looking for a talented and innovative Performance Engineer to join our team. As a Senior Performance Engineer at ClickUp, you will play a critical role in ensuring our platform’s speed, scalability, and reliability. You will drive end-to-end performance analysis, identify and resolve bottlenecks, and collaborate with engineering teams to deliver a world-class user experience at scale. If you are passionate about system optimization, deep technical analysis, and solving complex performance challenges, we want to hear from you!

Key Responsibilities:

Lead end-to-end performance analysis across frontend, backend, and infrastructure layers.

Profile and optimize application code, APIs, and database queries for maximum efficiency.

Investigate and resolve performance bottlenecks using observability and monitoring tools.

Collaborate with development, DevOps, and product teams to design scalable, high-performance solutions.

Build and maintain performance dashboards, metrics, and automated monitoring systems.

Conduct root cause analysis for performance incidents and drive long-term improvements.

Develop and implement strategies for continuous performance optimization and capacity planning.

Stay current with industry trends, tools, and best practices in performance engineering.

What We’re Looking For:

Strong experience with complex web application debugging, profiling, and performance optimization.

Deep understanding of browser performance traces, network analysis, and client-side profiling.

Proven background in performance engineering, including bottleneck analysis and root cause identification.

Hands-on experience with APM and observability tools (e.g., Datadog RUM, APM, DBM) for monitoring and troubleshooting.

Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network HAR files and performance metrics.

Experience optimizing across multiple application layers (frontend, backend, API, database).

Solid knowledge of logging, monitoring, and alerting best practices for both frontend and backend systems.

Familiarity with performance testing tools and frameworks (e.g., memlab, Chrome Dev tools).

Strong understanding of system architecture, distributed systems, and cloud environments (AWS, Kubernetes, CDN).

Passion for delivering a fast, stable, and scalable user experience.
