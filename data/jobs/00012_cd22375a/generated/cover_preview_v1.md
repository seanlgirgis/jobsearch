Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Performance Engineer position at ClickUp. With a mission to make the world more productive through intuitive tools, ClickUp’s commitment to excellence and growth resonates with my passion for optimizing systems and delivering scalable user experiences.

With over 20 years of experience in performance engineering and data optimization, I bring a proven track record of identifying and resolving bottlenecks across complex systems. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I managed dual APM environments using tools like CA Wily and AppDynamics, integrating disparate feeds for executive dashboards and conducting root cause analysis to enhance system reliability. My hands-on expertise with observability tools, including BMC TrueSight for infrastructure monitoring, aligns directly with ClickUp’s need for proficiency in APM and tools like Datadog RUM and APM. Additionally, my work in data mining underutilized infrastructure at CITI drove significant cost savings, showcasing my ability to optimize performance across layers.

My technical proficiency extends to cloud environments and distributed systems, key areas for ClickUp’s platform scalability. I have 7 years of advanced experience with AWS, recently designing a serverless data platform using S3, Glue, and Athena, ensuring efficient data access at enterprise scale. At G6 Hospitality in 2017, I led the 'FAST' project, data-mining real-user performance metrics with Dynatrace to provide optimization recommendations, mirroring ClickUp’s focus on web application debugging and performance metrics analysis. My background in system architecture and capacity planning, including ML forecasting models to predict bottlenecks 6 months ahead, positions me to contribute to continuous performance optimization and scalable solutions.

I am eager to bring my expertise in performance engineering and bottleneck analysis to ClickUp, helping to ensure platform speed and reliability for millions of users. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills in observability tools and system optimization can support your team’s goals. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to ClickUp’s mission of redefining productivity.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
