  "salutation": "Dear Hiring Manager,",
  "intro": "I am excited to apply for the Staff Data Engineer position at SCRIBD in Dallas, TX. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a passion for building scalable data platforms, I am eager to contribute to SCRIBD\u2019s mission of changing the way the world reads through innovative, user-centric solutions.",
  "body": [
    "In my recent role as Senior Capacity & Data Engineer at CITI, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas to ingest high-scale telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints, aligning with SCRIBD\u2019s need for robust data modeling and ETL design. I also designed a serverless lakehouse platform using AWS technologies like S3, Glue, and Athena, which mirrors your focus on lakehouse architecture and AWS data services. My expertise in PySpark and Spark enabled me to build parallel generator-based pipelines for projects like HorizonScale, reducing forecasting cycles by 90%, a skillset directly applicable to implementing scalable data pipelines with Databricks and Delta Lake at SCRIBD.",
    "Additionally, I have a proven track record in data orchestration and technical leadership. My experience with Airflow for workflow management and my development of ML forecasting models using Prophet and scikit-learn at CITI demonstrate my ability to handle complex batch workloads and drive data quality and governance. I have mentored teams and shaped long-term technical visions, as seen in my design of optimized Oracle schemas for seasonal risk forecasting. These experiences position me to contribute to SCRIBD\u2019s culture of operational excellence and continuous learning while supporting analytics and machine learning initiatives."

  "conclusion": "I am thrilled at the opportunity to bring my expertise in data engineering, lakehouse technologies, and mentorship to SCRIBD, helping to shape the future of your data platform. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills in Spark, Python, SQL optimization, and AWS can support your team\u2019s goals. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to SCRIBD\u2019s innovative journey.",
