# Score Report for 00015.SCRIBD.StaffDataEngineer.02062026.2041

## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Experience**: 20+ years in data engineering, surpassing the job’s requirement of 8+ years, with deep expertise in enterprise-scale data pipelines and architecture.
- **Technical Skills**: Expert in Python, SQL, and ETL design, aligning perfectly with required skills for Databricks, Delta Lake, and large-scale ETL processes.
- **AWS Familiarity**: Specialized in AWS serverless architectures (Glue, Athena), matching desired skills in AWS data services (S3, Glue, EMR).
- **Leadership & Strategy**: Proven track record in capacity planning, forecasting, and executive reporting, aligning with the role’s need for strategic vision and mentoring.
## Gaps & Risks
- **Databricks/Delta Lake Expertise**: While the candidate has strong data engineering skills, specific experience with Databricks and Delta Lake is not explicitly mentioned in the profile. *Mitigation*: Highlight transferable skills with Spark (via PySpark expertise) and quick adaptability to lakehouse technologies during interviews.
- **Streaming Architectures**: Limited evidence of experience with streaming tools like Kafka or Kinesis, which are desired skills. *Mitigation*: Emphasize multiprocessing and high-scale pipeline experience as a foundation for learning streaming workloads.
- **Subscription/Consumer Data Domains**: No direct experience mentioned in subscription or large-scale consumer data, a desired domain for Scribd. *Mitigation*: Showcase ability to adapt domain knowledge from financial (CITI) and hospitality sectors to consumer data challenges.
## Advice
- Tailor your application to emphasize PySpark and AWS expertise as direct parallels to Databricks and lakehouse architectures. If you’ve worked with Spark or similar tools, explicitly mention this.
- Prepare to discuss how your forecasting and telemetry pipeline experience can translate to Scribd’s analytics and ML needs for subscriber engagement.
- Research Databricks/Delta Lake basics and streaming tools (Kafka/Kinesis) to demonstrate learning agility during interviews.
- Highlight mentoring and strategic leadership examples to align with the role’s focus on guiding teams and shaping technical vision.
