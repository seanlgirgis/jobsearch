Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Staff Engineer position at Geico in Richardson, Texas. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a deep passion for leveraging technology to drive innovation, I am eager to contribute to Geico’s mission of providing affordable, high-quality insurance through cutting-edge data infrastructure solutions.

As a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer at CITI since 2017, I have honed my expertise in designing and optimizing scalable data systems, aligning closely with Geico’s focus on building high-performance Data Lakehouse platforms. My recent work on a Serverless Lakehouse Platform using AWS technologies such as Glue, Athena, and S3 demonstrates my ability to architect resilient, distributed systems. I also developed a Text-to-SQL GenAI agent with Bedrock, showcasing my capability to innovate with cloud computing and open-source frameworks. Additionally, my proficiency in Python and PySpark, with 15 and 6 years of experience respectively, positions me to excel in tuning and optimizing Apache Spark jobs for hyper-scale compute platforms, a critical requirement for this role.

My flagship project, HorizonScale, an AI Capacity Forecasting Engine, further aligns with Geico’s need for performance optimization and distributed systems expertise. By replacing legacy processes with a parallel generator-based pipeline using PySpark and Prophet, I reduced forecasting cycles by 90%, delivering real-time insights via interactive Streamlit dashboards. This experience in handling large-scale telemetry and driving compute efficiency mirrors the responsibilities of designing scalable Data Lakehouse components and leading performance projects at Geico. My advanced knowledge of AWS and data warehousing technologies also ensures I can contribute to evaluating and implementing new tools to enhance your data infrastructure.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my skills in Apache Spark, cloud computing, and distributed systems to Geico, supporting your digital transformation and engineering excellence. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background can contribute to your team’s success. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of an interview.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
