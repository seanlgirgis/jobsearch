- **Python & SQL Expertise**: 15+ years in Python and 18+ years in SQL, aligning perfectly with the job's core programming needs.
- **Cloud & Big Data Skills**: Deep experience with AWS (Glue/Athena/Bedrock) and big data technologies (ETL, capacity forecasting), matching the job's focus on cloud computing (1+ year required, 4+ preferred) and distributed data tools.
- **Linux/Unix Proficiency**: 20 years of expert-level experience, directly relevant to the 4+ years of UNIX/Linux experience preferred.
- **Leadership & Collaboration**: Proven track record in senior roles and executive reporting, aligning with the job's emphasis on mentoring and working across Agile teams.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Limited Experience with Specific Tools**: No explicit mention of experience with Scala, distributed tools like Hadoop/Hive/EMR/Kafka/Spark, or NoSQL databases (Mongo, Cassandra), which are preferred (4+ years desired). *Mitigation*: Highlight transferable skills with PySpark and other big data technologies; express willingness to quickly upskill in Scala or specific tools via training or self-study.
- **Real-Time Data/Streaming Applications**: No direct evidence of 4+ years in real-time data or streaming apps as preferred. *Mitigation*: Emphasize related experience in automated telemetry pipelines and multiprocessing to demonstrate adaptability.
