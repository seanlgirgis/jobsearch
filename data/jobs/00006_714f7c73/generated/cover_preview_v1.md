Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Lead Data Engineer position at Capital One in Plano, Texas. With a shared passion for leveraging technology to solve real customer problems, I am eager to contribute to your mission of changing banking for good through innovative, data-driven solutions.

With over 20 years of experience as a Senior Data Engineer, I have honed my expertise in application development and big data technologies, aligning closely with Capital One’s focus on full-stack development and cloud-based solutions. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas, ingesting telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints. My work with machine learning forecasting models, utilizing Prophet and scikit-learn, enabled bottleneck predictions six months in advance, directly supporting data-driven decision-making—an area where Capital One excels as a tech-driven financial leader.

My recent projects further demonstrate my alignment with your requirements in cloud computing and data warehousing. I designed a serverless lakehouse platform on AWS using Glue, Athena, and S3, optimizing ETL processes for enterprise scale. Additionally, my HorizonScale AI Capacity Forecasting Engine, built with PySpark and Python, reduced forecasting cycles by 90% and featured interactive Streamlit dashboards for real-time insights. With 7 years of AWS experience and advanced proficiency in data warehousing tools like Snowflake and Redshift, I am prepared to deliver robust solutions in a collaborative, Agile environment as emphasized in Capital One’s engineering culture.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my skills in Python, SQL, AWS, and big data technologies to Capital One, contributing to your innovative projects in Plano. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in data engineering and cloud computing can support your team’s goals. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of an interview.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
