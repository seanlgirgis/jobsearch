# Score Report for 00013.TheHershyCompany.SeniorDataEngineer.02062026.15.52

## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Experience**: Candidate has 20+ years of data engineering experience, far exceeding the 5-7 years required by Hershey, with a proven track record in enterprise-scale data pipelines and optimization.
- **Technical Proficiency**: Expert in Python and SQL, aligning perfectly with job requirements. Strong background in ETL design, data warehousing, and capacity planning matches the need for scalable data products and pipeline optimization.
- **Cloud Exposure**: While the job emphasizes Azure/Databricks, the candidate’s expertise in AWS (Glue/Athena) and serverless architectures demonstrates transferable cloud-native skills and adaptability to modern data platforms.
- **Collaboration & Communication**: Long history of executive-level reporting and cross-functional work (e.g., at CITI) aligns with the role’s need to translate business needs into technical solutions.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Specific Platform Experience**: Lacks direct experience with Azure and Databricks, which are preferred for this role. *Mitigation*: Candidate’s deep AWS expertise and adaptability (e.g., migrating legacy systems to cloud) suggest a quick learning curve; highlight willingness to upskill in Azure/Databricks during interviews.
- **Limited Recent Focus on Data Governance**: While the candidate has broad technical skills, there’s no explicit mention of governance-by-design or metadata/lineage frameworks as emphasized in the job. *Mitigation*: Emphasize transferable skills in documentation and telemetry pipelines; showcase any implicit governance work in past roles.

## Advice
- Tailor your resume and interview responses to highlight cloud migration expertise and adaptability to new platforms like Azure/Databricks—cite quick learning of AWS tools as evidence.
- Address governance by discussing any experience with data quality, monitoring, or standardization in past projects, even if not explicitly labeled as “governance.”
- Propose a 30-60-90 day plan in interviews to show intent to master Hershey’s tech stack and deliver early wins in pipeline scalability.
- Leverage your extensive experience to position yourself as a mentor for junior team members, adding value beyond technical contributions.
