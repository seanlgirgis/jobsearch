# Score Report for 00023 Qode Sr Data Engineer 02092026 1037

## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Experience**: Candidate has 20+ years of data engineering experience, far exceeding the job’s requirement of 12+ years in data-related solutions.
- **Technical Expertise**: Proficient in Python, SQL, and ETL design/optimization (15+ years each), aligning perfectly with the job’s advanced knowledge requirements for programming languages and ETL/ELT tools.
- **Database Knowledge**: 18+ years in SQL/Oracle and 10+ years in data warehousing, meeting and exceeding the job’s need for advanced database technology skills (Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, NoSQL).
- **Cloud Migration Skills**: Specialized in migrating legacy pipelines to serverless AWS architectures (Glue/Athena), demonstrating adaptability to cloud environments, which aligns with the job’s focus on cloud-based platforms like Azure.
## Gaps & Risks
- **Azure-Specific Experience**: Candidate lacks explicit mention of 4+ years of hands-on Azure experience (IaaS, PaaS, Azure SQL, Data Factory, Synapse, etc.), a core requirement for the role. *Mitigation*: Highlight transferable cloud skills (AWS expertise) and quick learning ability for Azure-specific tools during interviews; consider rapid upskilling via Azure certifications.
- **Microsoft Purview & DevOps Tools**: No mention of experience with Microsoft Purview or specific DevOps tools like Delphix/GenRocket, which are listed in the job description. *Mitigation*: Emphasize general DevOps and data governance knowledge, and express willingness to learn these tools on the job.
- **Location Constraint**: Role requires 90 days on-site in Plano, TX, or Camas, WA, with limited WFH initially. Candidate’s location isn’t specified, which could be a logistical issue. *Mitigation*: Confirm willingness and ability to relocate or commute for the initial period.
## Advice
- Tailor your resume and interview responses to emphasize cloud migration expertise and draw parallels between AWS and Azure technologies to address the Azure gap.
- Pursue a quick Azure Fundamentals certification (e.g., AZ-900) or a more advanced data engineering certification (e.g., DP-203) to demonstrate commitment and bridge the Azure-specific knowledge gap.
- Prepare examples of mentoring junior staff or leading cross-functional teams, as the role involves coaching and collaboration.
- Clarify your availability for on-site work in Plano, TX, or Camas, WA, during the initial 90 days to address potential location concerns.
