Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Sr Data Engineer position at Qode, as advertised. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a passion for leveraging cloud technologies to drive innovation, I am eager to contribute to your mission of empowering businesses through cutting-edge tech solutions.

My extensive background aligns closely with Qode’s focus on delivering scalable data platforms using cloud-based technologies. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas, ingesting telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints. I also designed serverless data platforms on AWS (Glue, Athena, S3), optimizing data processing for enterprise scale, which mirrors the data pipeline and cloud infrastructure expertise required for this role. My proficiency in SQL and Oracle, with 18 years of experience, complements your need for advanced database knowledge, including Microsoft SQL Server compatibility.

Additionally, I have a proven track record in building AI-driven solutions and data warehousing systems that support advanced analytics, aligning with Qode’s emphasis on innovation and collaboration. My recent project, HorizonScale, replaced legacy processes with a parallel generator-based pipeline using PySpark and Prophet, reducing forecasting cycles by 90%. I also developed interactive Streamlit dashboards for real-time insights, showcasing my ability to deliver business intelligence solutions. With 15 years of expertise in ETL design and optimization, I am prepared to design and deploy data extraction and transformation processes from diverse sources, as outlined in your responsibilities. I am excited to bring this technical excellence to Qode’s dynamic, growth-oriented environment.

I am confident that my skills in Python programming, SQL expertise, and cloud data architectures will add significant value to Qode’s wealth management client projects. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience with data pipelines and agile methodologies can support your team’s goals. Thank you for considering my application, and I am eager to contribute to Qode’s mission of digital transformation.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
