Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Staff Data Engineer position at PostScript. With a mission to empower e-commerce brands through innovative SMS marketing solutions, I am eager to contribute to your data platform evolution and support your growth in the competitive martech industry.

With over 20 years of experience in data engineering, including 8+ years focused on modern data stacks, I have honed expertise in building scalable data pipelines and architectures. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas, ingesting telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints. My recent projects include designing a serverless data lakehouse platform on AWS using S3, Glue, and Athena, aligning with PostScript’s vision for a v2 data architecture through models like Apache Iceberg. Additionally, my proficiency in AWS cloud architecture and experience with stream and batch processing via PySpark positions me to drive impactful data ingestion pipelines for your BI, Machine Learning, and Engineering teams.

My technical background also includes advanced skills in event-driven systems and diverse database technologies, which I believe align with PostScript’s needs for robust data access and analytics. My flagship project, HorizonScale, replaced legacy processes with a parallel generator-based pipeline, reducing forecasting cycles by 90% using PySpark and Python. This experience, coupled with my ability to collaborate cross-functionally, as demonstrated by integrating disparate feeds into unified Oracle reporting at CITI, equips me to support PostScript’s analytical and product needs. I am also drawn to your core values of Focus and Curiosity, which resonate with my approach to tackling complex data challenges with innovative solutions.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to lead PostScript’s data engineering practice and contribute to your mission of empowering e-commerce brands. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my expertise in data lakehouse models, AWS cloud architecture, and stream processing can support your team’s goals. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to PostScript’s success.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
