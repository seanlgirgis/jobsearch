Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Machine Learning Data Engineer position at Oden Technologies. With a passion for leveraging real-time data processing and machine learning to drive process optimization, I am eager to contribute to your mission of revolutionizing manufacturing through AI-driven solutions.

With over 20 years of experience as a Senior Data Engineer, I have honed my expertise in designing and deploying ML pipelines and distributed data processing systems. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I developed ML forecasting models using Python, Prophet, and scikit-learn to predict capacity bottlenecks six months ahead, improving provisioning accuracy. My recent project, HorizonScale, replaced legacy processes with a parallel generator-based pipeline, reducing forecasting cycles by 90% and featuring interactive Streamlit dashboards for real-time insights. These experiences align directly with Oden’s focus on prediction, anomaly detection, and manufacturing process optimization using advanced ML/AI algorithms.

Additionally, I have extensive experience with distributed systems and data engineering tools relevant to your requirements. My work on a Serverless Lakehouse Platform using AWS technologies like Glue, Athena, and S3, combined with PySpark for large-scale telemetry processing, demonstrates my ability to handle complex datasets and deploy scalable solutions. I am proficient in Python and have a strong background in ETL design and optimization, ensuring efficient data preparation and model deployment. I am excited to bring my skills in timeseries analysis and real-time data processing to Oden Technologies, supporting your innovative platform that integrates factory data for predictive insights and operational excellence.

I am thrilled at the opportunity to contribute to Oden Technologies’ mission of empowering manufacturers with actionable data. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my expertise in machine learning, distributed systems, and data engineering can support your team in driving Industry 4.0 transformations. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your impactful projects.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
