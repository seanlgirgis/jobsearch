About Oden:
Manufacturing is undergoing its fourth industrial revolution, with factory operations increasingly driven by real-time applications that combine process and context data with advanced ML and AI algorithms. This is unlocking a staggering opportunity to improve the efficiency and productivity of existing manufacturing processes.

As a Manufacturing AI company, Oden is at the forefront of this revolution. We combine large-scale data processing architectures and advanced AI and ML algorithms within the Oden platform so manufacturing operations teams can continuously monitor, analyze, and optimize their production, across a diverse set of processes and conditions. Our goal is to maximize efficiency, sustainability, and competitiveness in the manufacturing domain - to help True Makers Make Things Better!

Culture
We obsess over customers. Everything we do is to create profound results and delight for our customers. Every Viking cares about the purpose of the product and company, and prioritizes work based on customer end results. When in doubt, we go to the Gemba – we’re happy to put on steel toe boots and hit the factory floor to work with the production manager.
We move fast and follow through – we live by transparent and scientific thinking, act with urgency, and put in the work to find the best ideas with those around us.
We elevate each other by giving and receiving direct, honest feedback and holding ourselves and others to a high standard to help the team rise, deliver, and win together.
“Be True Makers to Serve True Makers.” We’re building a community that fuels innovation and accelerates our pace and impact. We always ask if there’s a better way to do something, even if it's unconventional – then we try it. We aim for bold yet simple solutions that cut through complexity and drive meaningful progress.
The Role:

As an ML Data Engineer, you will be responsible for researching, developing and implementing data and machine learning pipelines and systems to support applications that enable operations teams to manage and optimize the manufacturing process as effectively as possible. Applications for these systems include continuous predictions of quality, cost and machine failure, delivering live recommendations for process optimization, and identifying anomalies for real-time alerting etc.

As part of developing these systems, you will work with manufacturing data, including real-time sensor readings and measurements; context about this data collected from external systems; outcomes such as quality/cost/yield; and knowledge about the process from structured and unstructured sources. You will be expected to build systems and models that can learn from these high dimensional and heterogeneous timeseries datasets, and that can be adaptive to changing process conditions and explicit and implicit feedback. You will work with the latest techniques from deep learning, AI for timeseries, reinforcement learning, and recommendation systems to enable the applications.

You will work closely with Oden’s Product team to build these systems as foundations for our product, and are expected to participate in the end-to-end engineering, carrying projects from conceptualization to development to deployment. You will also work closely with our customer success teams to develop an understanding of the process and deliver and validate results in production environments.

Responsibilities:

Developing and maintaining systems that manage the full ML lifecycle - from data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring.
Working with our data scientists to create and deploy ML/AI models, algorithms, representations and methods that capture properties of complex manufacturing processes
Enable applications of these models to different problems for prediction, optimization, and monitoring and alerting.
Working with the engineering, product and customer success teams to Implement and deploy solutions
Validating results in real-world deployments with our customers
Generalizing solutions and innovating to create the next generation of product features
Engaging with the technical community to present results externally, keep up to date on recent advances, and advance the state of the art
Preferred Experience:

1-3 years professional experience as an ML Engineer/Data Engineer and advanced degrees (M.S. or PhD. in Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, Computer Science with ML/AI focus, or related fields)
Proficient with distributed data processing systems e.g. Apache Beam/Dataflow, Apache Spark
Proficient with ML workflows and tools - including open source tools like MLFlow, cloud platforms like Vertex or Sagemaker
Proficient with Python, including most common ML and Optimization libraries
Experience with SQL and GCP is a plus.
Experience with designing, building and deploying performant ML products
Familiarity with unstructured data and Generative AI - especially around enterprise applications is a plus.
Enthusiasm to own projects end-to-end; from experimentation to customer delivery
This person should be based in the New York metro-area and willing to come to an office at least a several times a month
We anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $120,000 and $190,000, in addition to equity and benefits. This role may be hired at the L3 Engineer level ($120,000 to $170,000) or the Senior ML Engineer level ($140,000 to $190,000). The salary at offer will be determined by factors such as the candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.

At Oden, we are deeply committed to ensuring that every team member is engaged in work they are passionate about and find fulfilling. We prioritze your career development, offering personalized pathways for growth and advancement. Our approach is to align your strengths and interests with the company’s goals, ensuring that you not only contribute meaningfully but also progress steadily in your professional journey, reaching new heights in your career.
