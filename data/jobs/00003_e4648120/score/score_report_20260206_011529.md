## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Experience**: Candidate has 20+ years of data engineering experience, surpassing the job’s requirement of 15+ years, with deep expertise in ETL design, data warehousing, and pipeline optimization.
- **Technical Skills Overlap**: Strong proficiency in Python (15 yrs, Expert), SQL (18 yrs, Expert), and data processing aligns with job needs for advanced knowledge in these areas.
- **Enterprise-Level Impact**: Proven track record in designing scalable data solutions and executive reporting at large organizations like CITI, matching Fisher Investments’ focus on scalable, strategic data platforms.
- **Capacity Planning Expertise**: 15 years of forecasting and capacity planning experience aligns with the role’s need for advanced analytics and data-driven solutions.
## Gaps & Risks
- **Limited Azure-Specific Experience**: Job requires 4+ years of hands-on Azure experience (Azure SQL, Data Factory, Synapse, etc.), but the candidate’s profile emphasizes AWS (Glue, Athena, Bedrock) with no explicit mention of Azure. *Mitigation*: Highlight transferable cloud skills and express eagerness to upskill in Azure through certifications or on-the-job learning.
- **Lack of DevOps/CI/CD Exposure**: Job lists Azure DevOps and CI/CD pipelines as key requirements, but candidate’s profile does not explicitly mention these tools or processes. *Mitigation*: Emphasize related experience in automation and pipeline development, and commit to quickly learning specific tools.
## Advice
- Tailor your resume and interview responses to emphasize transferable cloud skills (AWS to Azure) and your ability to adapt to new technologies, referencing your history of learning and mastering diverse tech stacks.
- Pursue a quick Azure Fundamentals certification (e.g., AZ-900) or relevant online courses to demonstrate initiative and close the Azure knowledge gap before interviews.
- Highlight your mentorship experience (if any) or willingness to coach junior staff, as the role includes guiding others on technical growth.
- Prepare specific examples of past projects where you’ve designed scalable data pipelines and collaborated with cross-functional teams, aligning with Fisher Investments’ Agile and collaborative environment.
