Fisher Investments
Plano, Texas

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Data Engineer position at Fisher Investments in Plano, Texas. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a passion for designing scalable, cloud-based data solutions, I am eager to contribute to your mission of providing superior investment management services with a client-first approach.

In my current role as Senior Capacity & Data Engineer at CITI, I have architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas, ingesting high-scale telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints. My expertise in relational databases, including 18 years with SQL and Oracle, aligns directly with your requirements for advanced knowledge of database technologies like Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle. Additionally, I have designed serverless data platforms on AWS (Glue, Athena, S3), demonstrating my capability to deliver modern data solutions using cloud-based infrastructure, a key responsibility for this role at Fisher Investments.

My flagship project, HorizonScale, an AI-driven capacity forecasting engine, showcases my ability to develop data pipelines and optimize data processing systems. Using PySpark and Prophet, I reduced forecasting cycles by 90%, providing real-time insights through interactive Streamlit dashboards. This experience, combined with 15 years of expertise in ETL design and optimization, positions me to effectively design and deploy data extraction, transformation, and loading processes (ETL/ELT) from various sources, as outlined in your job description. I am confident my skills in Python and data governance will support Fisher Investments’ focus on secure, compliant data platforms for advanced analytics and AI.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my extensive experience in data pipeline development and cloud technologies to Fisher Investments, contributing to your innovative and growth-oriented culture. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background aligns with your needs. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
