# Score Report for 00021 DTCC Lead Database Engineer 02072026 2238

## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Database Expertise**: 18+ years of SQL/Oracle/PL-SQL experience aligns perfectly with the job’s RDBMS requirements (Snowflake, Oracle, MS SQL, etc.).
- **Python Proficiency**: 15 years of expert-level Python skills match the need for Python programming in Snowflake administration and data engineering tasks.
- **Linux/Unix Mastery**: 20 years of Linux/Unix experience supports the role’s requirement for Linux batch scheduling (Autosys) and Bash scripting.
- **ETL & Data Warehousing**: 15 years of ETL design/optimization and 10 years of data warehousing experience align with Snowflake integration and data cloud ecosystem tasks.
- **Cloud & Automation Exposure**: Experience with AWS architectures (Glue/Athena) and automation tools complements the job’s AWS IaaS and Terraform/Ansible requirements.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Limited Snowflake-Specific Experience**: No direct mention of Snowflake administration or SnowPro Core certification, which is a preferred qualification. *Mitigation*: Highlight transferable skills from Oracle/SQL expertise and commit to rapid certification or training in Snowflake.
- **CI/CD Tool Familiarity**: While experienced in automation, specific tools like GitLab, Bitbucket, or Jenkins are not explicitly mentioned in the profile. *Mitigation*: Emphasize adaptability and prior experience with similar automation workflows; seek quick upskilling if needed.
- **FinOps Knowledge**: No explicit mention of FinOps concepts for cost/performance optimization. *Mitigation*: Showcase capacity planning/forecasting expertise (15 years) as a related skill and express willingness to learn FinOps principles.

## Advice
- Tailor your resume to emphasize transferable skills (SQL, Python, AWS) relevant to Snowflake and cloud data ecosystems. Explicitly mention any indirect exposure to Snowflake or similar platforms.
- Pursue SnowPro Core certification immediately to close the Snowflake expertise gap; many resources are available online for quick preparation.
- Prepare examples of past projects involving database performance optimization, cloud migration, or automation to demonstrate alignment with DTCC’s strategic data goals.
- In interviews, focus on your 20+ years of enterprise experience and ability to adapt to new tools (e.g., CI/CD, FinOps) by citing your history of learning and applying complex technologies like GenAI and serverless architectures.
