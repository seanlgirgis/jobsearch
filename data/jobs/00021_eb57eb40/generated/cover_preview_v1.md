Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Lead Database Engineer position at DTCC in Coppell, TX. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a deep alignment with DTCC’s mission to safeguard financial markets through innovative technology, I am eager to contribute to your data foundation using Snowflake and cloud solutions.

As a Senior Data Engineer at CITI since 2017, I have honed my expertise in database engineering, SQL programming, and cloud technologies, directly aligning with the requirements of this role. My work includes architecting automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas to ingest high-scale telemetry data, as well as designing optimized Oracle schemas for historical retention and risk forecasting. Additionally, I have 7 years of advanced experience with AWS, including serverless architectures using Glue, Athena, and S3, which complements DTCC’s focus on AWS administration and cloud innovation. My recent project, a Serverless Lakehouse Platform, optimized ETL processes for enterprise scale, a skill I am prepared to apply to enhance Snowflake administration and performance at DTCC.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring a proven track record in capacity planning and data optimization, critical for implementing FinOps concepts and ensuring cost-effective solutions. My HorizonScale AI Capacity Forecasting Engine, developed with Python, PySpark, and Prophet, reduced forecasting cycles by 90% through parallel processing and delivered real-time insights via Streamlit dashboards. With 15 years of Linux experience and proficiency in Git for version control, I am well-equipped to support CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation. My collaborative approach, honed through years of working with cross-functional teams, aligns with DTCC’s culture of excellence and innovation, and I am eager to integrate Snowflake with observability tools like Dynatrace, leveraging my 8 years of expertise in this area.

I am confident that my extensive experience in database engineering, cloud technologies, and data optimization positions me as a strong candidate to drive DTCC’s strategic initiatives with Snowflake. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills can contribute to your team’s success. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of an interview.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
