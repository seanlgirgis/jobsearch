# Score Report for 00010.Stefanini.DataEngineer.02062026.1414

## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Data Engineering Experience**: Candidate has 20+ years of experience in data engineering, far exceeding the job's requirement of 3+ years with Python/PySpark and 2+ years with modern data stacks.
- **Python & PySpark Expertise**: Candidate has 15 years of expert-level Python experience and aligns perfectly with the job's focus on PySpark and Databricks.
- **Cloud & ETL Skills**: Strong background in ETL design/optimization and AWS architectures matches the job's emphasis on cloud data pipelines (e.g., S3, Spark, Lakehouse) and AWS services.
- **Scalable Pipeline Development**: Proven expertise in building high-scale, automated telemetry pipelines aligns with the role's need for scalable, secure data pipelines.
## Gaps & Risks
- **Specific Tool Exposure**: Limited direct experience with Databricks, Collibra, Starburst, and Tableau as explicitly mentioned in the job description. *Mitigation*: Candidate’s deep expertise in similar tools (e.g., AWS Glue, Athena) and adaptability with 20+ years of tech experience suggest a quick learning curve for these platforms.
- **Agile Process Familiarity**: Job emphasizes Scaled Agile practices and Agile rituals; candidate’s profile does not explicitly mention Agile experience. *Mitigation*: Highlight any indirect exposure to collaborative or iterative workflows during interviews; express willingness to adapt to Agile methodologies.
## Advice
- Emphasize your extensive experience in data pipeline design and cloud migrations (AWS) to showcase alignment with the role’s core needs. Provide specific examples of projects involving large-scale data ingestion and transformation.
- Address tool gaps by demonstrating your ability to learn new technologies quickly, referencing your history of adapting to diverse tech stacks (e.g., from C++ to Python to GenAI).
- Prepare to discuss how you’ve collaborated with cross-functional teams (e.g., executives at CITI) to meet business data needs, aligning with the job’s stakeholder collaboration requirement.
- Research Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) basics to show readiness to integrate into their processes during the interview.
