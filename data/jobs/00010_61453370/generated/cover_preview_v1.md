Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Data Engineer position at Stefanini Group. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a passion for designing scalable data pipelines, I am eager to contribute to your Common Data Platform (CDP) initiative.

As a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer at CITI, I have honed my expertise in building efficient data pipelines using Python, PySpark, and AWS services like S3, Glue, and Athena. My recent project, a Serverless Lakehouse Platform, involved designing a full serverless data platform that optimized ETL processes for enterprise-scale data access, aligning with your focus on cloud data warehouses like RedShift and Snowflake. Additionally, I have extensive experience with Spark architecture, ensuring high performance for big data processing, which directly relates to your requirements for handling unstructured and semi-structured data.

My flagship project, HorizonScale, an AI Capacity Forecasting Engine, showcases my ability to deliver high-quality data products. By leveraging Python, PySpark, and multiprocessing, I reduced forecasting cycles by 90% and developed interactive Streamlit dashboards for real-time insights. This experience aligns with Stefanini Group’s emphasis on Agile practices and data security, as I incorporated automation and monitoring to ensure reliability. My proficiency in Airflow for orchestration and ETL design further complements your need for robust data infrastructure and modern data stacks.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my skills in Python, PySpark, AWS, and big data solutions to Stefanini Group. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in designing scalable data pipelines can support your CDP program. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
