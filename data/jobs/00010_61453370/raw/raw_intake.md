Position Summary

We currently have multiple openings for Contract Workers to join us in Data Engineer roles for one year assignments to implement and manage data products, ensuring that our data pipelines are scalable, secure, and efficient.
 
We are working to modernize how we manage and leverage it. The Common Data Platform (CDP) is an exciting new, multi-district program to create a cloud based, end-to-end data management platform to reduce data cost and improve user experience. Initially CDP was developed in partnership with the Supervision and Regulation business, but this system is now positioned to become 'the standard' data management platform.

As a Data Engineer, this CW will be responsible for collecting, parsing, managing, analyzing, and visualizing large sets of data to turn information into actionable insights. They will work across multiple platforms to ensure that data pipelines are scalable, repeatable, and secure, capable of serving multiple users.

 

Responsibilities:

Design, develop, and maintain robust and efficient data pipelines to ingest, transform, catalog, and deliver curated, trusted, and quality data from disparate sources into our Common Data Platform.
Actively participate in Agile rituals and follow Scaled Agile processes as set forth by the CDP Program team.
Deliver high-quality data products and services following Safe Agile Practices.
Proactively identify and resolve issues with data pipelines and analytical data stores.
Deploy monitoring and alerting for data pipelines and data stores, implementing auto-remediation where possible to ensure system availability and reliability.
Employ a security-first, testing, and automation strategy, adhering to data engineering best practices.
Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including product management, data scientists, analysts, and business stakeholders, to understand their data requirements and provide them with the necessary infrastructure and tools.
Keep up with the latest trends and technologies, evaluating and recommending new tools, frameworks, and technologies to improve data engineering processes and efficiencies.
