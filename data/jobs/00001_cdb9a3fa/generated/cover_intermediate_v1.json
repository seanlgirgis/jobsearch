I have utilized Airflow for orchestration of data pipelines over the past 5 years, ensuring efficient ELT workflows. My recent projects include designing a serverless lakehouse platform on AWS (Glue, Athena, S3), optimizing data access for enterprise scale, and building AI-driven forecasting engines like HorizonScale, which reduced forecasting cycles by 90% using PySpark and multiprocessing. These achievements highlight my ability to optimize workflows, promote consistency through reusable frameworks, and provide technical leadership—key aspects of mentoring team members and enhancing engineering quality as outlined in the role responsibilities."
