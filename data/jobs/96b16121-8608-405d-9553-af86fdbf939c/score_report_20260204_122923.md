## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Data Engineering Experience**: Candidate has 20+ years of enterprise experience as a Senior Data Engineer, surpassing the required 12+ years, with expertise in ETL design, optimization, and data warehousing, directly aligning with the role’s focus on ingestion and transformation pipelines.
- **SQL and Python Proficiency**: Expert-level SQL (18 years) and Python (15 years) skills match the job’s requirement for strong proficiency in SQL and a programming language like Python, critical for ELT pipelines and data modeling.
- **Technical Leadership Potential**: While not in a formal management role, the candidate’s long tenure in senior positions (e.g., Senior Capacity & Data Engineer at CITI) suggests capability to lead technical strategy and mentor a small team of 2–4 engineers as required.
- **Data Pipeline and Optimization Expertise**: 15 years of ETL design and capacity planning experience align with the job’s emphasis on building scalable data flows, orchestration, and operational reliability.
- **Experience with Large-Scale Systems**: Work at major enterprises like CITI indicates familiarity with high-scale, complex data environments, relevant to Collective Health’s need for robust data warehouse models.
## Gaps & Risks
- **Limited Exposure to Modern Data Tools**: The candidate’s profile does not mention experience with modern data warehouse technologies like Snowflake, Databricks, or BigQuery, nor orchestration tools like Airflow or DBT, which are explicitly required (Mitigation: Highlight transferable skills with similar tools and commit to rapid learning of these platforms through online courses or certifications).
- **Lack of Healthcare Domain Knowledge**: No prior experience in healthcare or regulated data environments, which is a plus for the role (Mitigation: Emphasize adaptability and ability to learn domain-specific requirements quickly, leveraging existing experience in large, regulated enterprises like CITI).
- **Unclear Focus on Dimensional Modeling**: While data warehousing is listed as a skill, there’s no specific mention of expertise in dimensional models (facts and dimensions), a core requirement (Mitigation: In the resume or interview, provide examples of past work that involved similar data structuring, even if under a different terminology).
- **Hybrid Work Location Constraint**: The role requires being in-office two days per week in San Francisco, CA, Plano, TX, or Lehi, UT; candidate’s location is not specified and may pose a logistical issue (Mitigation: Confirm willingness to relocate or work hybrid if feasible, or negotiate remote flexibility if possible).
## Advice
Tailor your resume to emphasize transferable skills in data pipeline design and warehousing, and proactively address gaps in modern tools by showcasing your learning agility. Prepare to discuss how your extensive experience in large-scale, regulated environments can translate to healthcare data challenges.
