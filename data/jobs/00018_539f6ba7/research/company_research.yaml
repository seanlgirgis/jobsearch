research: 'Google was founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were
  Ph.D. students at Stanford University, initially as a search engine project called
  "BackRub." It rapidly evolved into a global technology leader, incorporating under
  the name Google Inc. and expanding into diverse areas such as cloud computing, Android
  OS, AI, and hardware. Headquartered in Mountain View, California, Google became
  a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. in 2015, reflecting its growth into a conglomerate
  with over 190,000 employees worldwide as of 2023. Its mission is "to organize the
  world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful," a goal that
  drives its focus on innovation and cutting-edge technology, particularly relevant
  for tech and engineering roles.


  Google’s core values, often summarized in its "Ten things we know to be true" philosophy,
  emphasize user focus, speed, and a commitment to innovation, encouraging engineers
  to tackle complex problems with creativity. The company fosters a culture of collaboration
  and experimentation, exemplified by its historical "20% time" policy, allowing employees
  to work on passion projects, which led to products like Gmail. Google supports remote
  and hybrid work options, adapting to modern workforce needs, and remains in a mature
  growth stage, balancing scale with continuous innovation in AI and machine learning.
  Its engineering culture prioritizes data-driven decision-making and technical excellence,
  creating an environment where professionals can work on impactful, large-scale projects.'
