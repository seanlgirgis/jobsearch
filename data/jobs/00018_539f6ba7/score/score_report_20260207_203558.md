- **SQL & Data Analysis**: With 18 years of expert-level SQL/Oracle experience and 10+ years in data warehousing and analytics, the candidate aligns perfectly with the job’s focus on data analysis and SQL for business and technology decisions.
- **Scalable Systems Experience**: Expertise in ETL design, optimization, and serverless AWS architectures demonstrates the ability to build and maintain scalable systems, directly relevant to operationalizing incentive systems at YouTube.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Domain-Specific Experience**: Limited direct experience in operations management or incentives systems specific to digital platforms like YouTube. *Mitigation*: Leverage the candidate’s extensive background in capacity planning and forecasting to adapt quickly to incentive system design and operational workflows.
- **Recent Focus on Data Engineering**: The candidate’s recent roles are heavily focused on data engineering and capacity planning, which may not fully align with the operational and business analytics focus of this role. *Mitigation*: Highlight transferable skills in data-driven decision-making and cross-functional collaboration during the interview process.
