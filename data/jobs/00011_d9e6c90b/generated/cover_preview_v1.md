Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Lead Engineer, Performance Engineering position at SEPHORA. With a passion for driving scalability and reliability in high-traffic systems, I am eager to contribute to your mission of creating a welcoming beauty community through innovative digital platforms.

With over 20 years of experience in performance engineering and data infrastructure, I have honed my expertise in ensuring stability and scalability for mission-critical systems. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas, ingesting telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints with tools like BMC TrueSight. My work included developing machine learning forecasting models with Prophet and scikit-learn to predict bottlenecks six months ahead, directly aligning with SEPHORA’s need for capacity planning and bottleneck analysis. Additionally, my experience with observability tools like Dynatrace and AppDynamics, used extensively during my tenure at G6 Hospitality in 2017, equips me to build robust monitoring frameworks for performance metrics.

My technical proficiency in cloud platforms and distributed systems further complements SEPHORA’s requirements. I have seven years of advanced experience with AWS, designing serverless architectures using Glue, Athena, and S3 for enterprise-scale data platforms. My recent project, HorizonScale, replaced legacy processes with a parallel generator-based pipeline, reducing forecasting cycles by 90% using PySpark and Python. This aligns with your focus on microservices, APIs, and cloud-native systems. I am also skilled in Docker for containerization, ensuring seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines for performance checks. At SEPHORA, I am inspired by your commitment to innovation and diversity, and I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge solutions that enhance customer experiences through e-commerce platforms.

I am confident that my extensive background in performance engineering, cloud platforms, and observability tools positions me to make a meaningful impact at SEPHORA. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
