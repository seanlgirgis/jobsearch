# Score Report for 00009.RTX.DataEngineer.02062026.1344

## Match Score: 85%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Extensive Data Engineering Experience**: Candidate has 20+ years of experience in data engineering, far exceeding the job's requirement of 3-5 years, with expertise in designing and optimizing ETL processes and data pipelines.
- **SQL Proficiency**: Candidate's 18 years of expert-level SQL experience aligns perfectly with the job's emphasis on writing complex queries and optimizing performance.
- **Python Expertise**: 15 years of Python experience, including Pandas and PySpark, supports the role's need for data manipulation and pipeline development.
- **Collaboration & Communication**: Candidate's background in executive-level reporting and cross-functional roles at CITI demonstrates strong communication and teamwork skills, critical for this position.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Lack of Specific Tool Experience**: The job requires hands-on experience with Snowflake, Matillion, Alteryx, and Tableau, none of which are listed in the candidate’s profile. *Mitigation*: Candidate’s deep expertise in similar ETL tools, data warehousing (Oracle RAC), and visualization/reporting suggests a quick learning curve for these tools.
- **Aerospace Domain Knowledge**: No prior experience in aerospace or related industries is mentioned, which may impact domain-specific understanding. *Mitigation*: Candidate’s extensive enterprise experience across sectors (e.g., finance at CITI) indicates adaptability to new industries.
- **Hybrid Work Location**: The role requires hybrid work at specific U.S. locations, which may pose logistical challenges depending on the candidate’s location. *Mitigation*: Confirm candidate’s willingness and ability to relocate or commute as needed.

## Advice
- Highlight transferable skills in your application, such as ETL design, data warehousing, and SQL optimization, to bridge the gap with Snowflake and Matillion. Consider quick upskilling via online courses or certifications in these tools (e.g., Snowflake SnowPro, Tableau basics) to demonstrate initiative.
- Emphasize your adaptability and success in cross-functional, fast-paced environments to address potential concerns about industry-specific knowledge.
- Confirm your availability for hybrid work at one of the specified locations (Charlotte, NC; Windsor Locks, CT; Cedar Rapids, IA; Richardson, TX) during the application or interview process.
- Leverage your senior-level experience to position yourself as a mentor or lead within the team, adding value beyond technical skills.
