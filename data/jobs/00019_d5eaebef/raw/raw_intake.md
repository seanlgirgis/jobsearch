Code-based data transformations unlock transparency, flexibility, and collaboration
Analysts should adopt software engineering best practices to build trusted data products
Core analytics infrastructure should be open source and user-controlled
Analytic code—not just tools—should be shared and community-driven

About the Role
We’re seeking a tenured Solutions Architect to join our high-performing Central Solutions Architecture team and drive meaningful customer and revenue impact. This role is focused on one of dbt’s most strategic and fastest-growing territories, with strong enterprise demand and significant upside for top performers.

You’ll lead complex technical evaluations, deliver executive-level demos, and serve as a trusted advisor to large, sophisticated customers. Partnering closely with Sales, Product, and Engineering, you’ll help customers scale their analytics practices and unlock value from dbt.

You’ll join a team that consistently wins large, multi-year enterprise deals and plays a key role in shaping how dbt competes in the market. As dbt continues to expand its enterprise footprint and platform capabilities, this role plays a critical part in that next phase of growth.

We’re looking for leaders who are excited to mentor others, influence product direction, and help define how we win and expand strategic accounts. This role offers a clear path to growth toward senior IC roles, enterprise specialization, or people leadership.

While we’re especially interested in candidates based in Texas, we’re open to applicants elsewhere in the Central U.S., with periodic (typically monthly) travel for key engagements.

What You’ll Do
Architect and deliver enterprise-scale analytics platforms using dbt Cloud
Partner with Sales to win and expand strategic accounts by demonstrating clear technical and business value
Lead complex proof-of-value engagements and executive-level technical evaluations
Own the technical customer journey from pre-sales through long-term adoption and expansion
Partner with Product and Engineering to shape enterprise features and platform direction
Enable and work closely with key partners (Snowflake, Databricks, AWS) to accelerate customer success
Represent dbt externally through community leadership, thought leadership, and industry engagement
Travel ~10–20% to support key customer engagements, executive meetings, and POVs
What You’ll Need
5+ years of experience in sales engineering, solutions architecture, data engineering, or other customer-facing technical roles
Strong hands-on expertise in SQL, data modeling, and building production-grade data pipelines
Deep understanding of modern data stacks and cloud data platforms (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, AWS, GCP, Azure)
Proven ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly to technical and executive audiences
Experience translating business objectives and technical requirements into scalable, real-world solutions
Strong written and verbal communication skills, including customer-facing presentations and documentation
Comfort operating in fast-paced, ambiguous environments with shifting priorities
A collaborative mindset and commitment to mentorship, inclusion, and continuous learning
What Will Make You Stand Out
A track record of influencing and closing large, complex enterprise opportunities
Experience leading high-stakes proof-of-value engagements from discovery through executive readout
Strong instincts for identifying expansion and platform adoption opportunities within strategic accounts
Ability to operate as a trusted advisor to senior technical and business leaders
Demonstrated impact on product direction, go-to-market strategy, or internal best practices
Passion for mentoring teammates and raising the technical bar across the organization
