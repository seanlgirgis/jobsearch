# Score Report for 00019.DBT Labs. Staff Sales Engineer. 02072026. 2121

## Match Score: 65%
## Recommendation: Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Technical Expertise in Data Engineering**: Candidate’s 20+ years of experience in data engineering, ETL design, and data warehousing aligns well with dbt Labs’ focus on analytics engineering and building production-grade data pipelines.
- **Proficiency in SQL and Data Modeling**: With 18 years of expert-level SQL and Oracle experience, the candidate meets the core technical requirement for architecting enterprise-scale analytics platforms using dbt Cloud.
- **Cloud and Modern Data Stack Knowledge**: Expertise in AWS serverless architectures (Glue/Athena) and cloud migration demonstrates familiarity with modern data platforms, a key requirement for the role.
- **Experience with Large-Scale Systems**: Background in high-scale capacity forecasting and automated telemetry pipelines shows capability to handle enterprise-scale challenges, matching the job’s focus on strategic accounts.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Limited Sales Engineering Experience**: The candidate lacks explicit experience in sales engineering or customer-facing technical roles like solutions architecture (required 5+ years). Their background is heavily focused on hands-on engineering rather than pre-sales or customer journey ownership. *Mitigation*: Highlight transferable skills in executive-level reporting and cross-functional collaboration during interviews; emphasize ability to learn sales-oriented skills quickly.
- **Unclear Experience with dbt or Analytics Engineering Tools**: No mention of direct experience with dbt or similar analytics engineering platforms, which are central to the role. *Mitigation*: Study dbt fundamentals and showcase adaptability by referencing quick learning of tools like PySpark and GenAI agents in past roles.
- **Lack of Demonstrated Mentorship or Community Leadership**: The role emphasizes mentoring and external representation (thought leadership, community engagement), which isn’t evident in the candidate’s profile. *Mitigation*: Prepare examples of informal mentorship or team leadership from past roles and express enthusiasm for community involvement.
- **Geographic Fit**: While based in Texas (a plus), the role requires travel (10-20%), and the candidate’s profile doesn’t indicate flexibility or past experience with travel-heavy roles. *Mitigation*: Confirm willingness and ability to travel during interviews.

## Advice
- **Tailor Application to Sales Engineering**: Reframe past experience to emphasize customer-facing aspects (e.g., executive reporting at CITI) and problem-solving for stakeholders. Highlight business impact of technical solutions to bridge the gap in formal sales engineering experience.
- **Learn dbt Basics**: Invest time in understanding dbt’s core concepts (e.g., code-based transformations, analytics engineering) through online resources or tutorials before interviews. Mention this initiative to demonstrate proactive learning.
- **Prepare for Technical and Business Scenarios**: Be ready for the technical screen and executive-level demos by practicing translating complex data engineering concepts into business value propositions. Focus on how your forecasting and pipeline optimization work drove measurable outcomes.
- **Showcase Soft Skills**: Emphasize communication, collaboration, and adaptability in past roles to address the role’s need for mentorship and customer engagement. Prepare to discuss how you’ve influenced cross-functional teams or advised stakeholders.
- **Express Growth Mindset**: Acknowledge gaps in sales engineering experience but frame them as areas of excitement and growth. Highlight your 20+ years of learning and adapting to new technologies as evidence of your ability to pivot into this role.
