Dallas, Texas, United States

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Staff Sales Engineer position at dbt Labs in Texas. With a deep admiration for your mission to empower data practitioners through innovative tools like dbt Cloud, I am eager to contribute my expertise in data engineering and customer-facing technical roles to drive customer success and revenue impact in your high-growth territory.

With over 20 years of experience as a Senior Data Engineer, including 5+ years in customer-facing technical roles, I bring a proven track record of architecting enterprise-scale analytics platforms and data pipelines. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I designed automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas, ingesting telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints, and developed ML forecasting models with Prophet and scikit-learn to predict capacity bottlenecks six months ahead. My expertise in SQL, data modeling, and cloud data platforms like AWS (Glue, Athena, S3) aligns directly with dbt Labs’ requirements for constructing production-grade data pipelines and leading complex technical evaluations.

Additionally, my recent projects, such as designing a Serverless Lakehouse Platform on AWS and building HorizonScale—an AI Capacity Forecasting Engine—demonstrate my ability to deliver scalable solutions and influence platform development. The HorizonScale project reduced forecasting cycles by 90% using PySpark and multiprocessing, showcasing my capability to manage intricate proof-of-value engagements. I have also collaborated with cross-functional teams to translate business goals into technical solutions, a skill critical for partnering with Sales to secure strategic accounts and serving as a trusted advisor to enterprise customers at dbt Labs.

I am thrilled at the opportunity to bring my passion for analytics engineering and commitment to excellence to dbt Labs, a company whose values of transparency and community resonate deeply with me. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background in data pipelines, cloud platforms, and customer success can contribute to your team’s goals. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of an interview.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
