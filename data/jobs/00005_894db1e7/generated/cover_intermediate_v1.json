  "salutation": "Dear Hiring Manager,",
  "intro": "I am excited to apply for the Senior Engineer position at Geico in Richardson, Texas. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a passion for building scalable, automated solutions, I am eager to contribute to your mission of providing affordable, high-quality insurance through innovative digital platforms.",
  "body": [
    "As a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer at CITI since 2017, I have architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas to ingest high-scale telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints, aligning with your need for robust data pipelines and automation solutions. My expertise in SQL and data warehousing enabled the design of optimized Oracle schemas for historical retention and seasonal forecasting, directly supporting data-driven decision-making. Additionally, I developed ML forecasting models with Prophet and scikit-learn to predict capacity bottlenecks six months ahead, a skillset that complements Geico\u2019s focus on business intelligence and executive reporting. My recent projects, including a serverless lakehouse platform on AWS using Glue, Athena, and S3, demonstrate my proficiency in cloud services and big data technologies like Apache Spark and PySpark, which are critical for your role.",
    "I have also led initiatives that mirror Geico\u2019s emphasis on efficiency and scalability, such as the HorizonScale AI Capacity Forecasting Engine, where I reduced forecasting cycles by 90% through parallel generator-based pipelines. My experience with tools like Airflow for orchestration, Docker for containerization, and Git for version control aligns with your requirements for CI/CD pipelines and modern engineering practices. Furthermore, my background in creating interactive dashboards with Streamlit equips me to deliver high-quality data visualizations akin to Power BI, ensuring actionable insights for platform health monitoring and governance frameworks. I am confident that my collaborative approach and mentorship experience will contribute to enhancing engineering quality across your cross-functional teams."
  ],
  "conclusion": "I am thrilled at the opportunity to bring my expertise in data analytics, automation, and big data technologies to Geico, supporting your commitment to innovation and customer-first solutions. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.",
