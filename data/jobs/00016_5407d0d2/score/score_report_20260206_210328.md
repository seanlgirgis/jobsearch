# Score Report for 00016.ATT.LeadData.AIEngineering.02062026.2102

## Match Score: 92%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Technical Expertise**: Candidate’s 20+ years of experience in data engineering, with deep expertise in Python, PySpark, SQL, and ETL design, aligns perfectly with the job’s focus on scalable Data & AI solutions using Spark, Python, and SQL.
- **Cloud & Scalability**: Proficiency in AWS serverless architectures (Glue/Athena) matches the job’s requirement for cloud platform expertise (AWS/Azure) and platform scalability/optimization.
- **AI & Data Insights**: Experience with GenAI agents (Text-to-SQL) and forecasting (Prophet/scikit-learn) directly supports the role’s emphasis on transforming complex data into actionable insights using advanced AI techniques.
- **Leadership & Autonomy**: Senior-level experience (20+ years) and executive reporting skills align with the job’s need for strategic autonomy, mentoring, and collaboration with senior leadership.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Specific Tool Exposure**: Limited direct mention of Kafka, Databricks, or Snowflake, which are highlighted in the job description. *Mitigation*: Candidate’s extensive experience with similar tools (e.g., PySpark, AWS stack) and adaptability (evidenced by learning GenAI and serverless tech) suggests quick upskilling potential.
- **Office Presence**: Job requires 5 days/week onsite in Dallas, TX, with no relocation offered. If the candidate is not local, this could be a barrier. *Mitigation*: Confirm candidate’s location and willingness to work onsite full-time.
- **Formal Education**: Job prefers a Bachelor’s degree in a related field; candidate’s education is not specified. *Mitigation*: 20+ years of experience likely outweighs this preference, especially with proven expertise.

## Advice
- Highlight AWS serverless expertise and GenAI projects in your application to directly address the Data & AI focus of the role. Provide specific examples of scalable pipeline migrations and executive-level impact.
- If not local to Dallas, TX, proactively address your willingness to work onsite 5 days/week in your cover letter or interview.
- Research Kafka, Databricks, and Snowflake briefly to demonstrate awareness and readiness to adapt your existing skills (e.g., PySpark, AWS tools) to these platforms if needed.
- Emphasize mentoring and strategic leadership experience to align with the role’s expectations for influencing decisions and guiding teams.
