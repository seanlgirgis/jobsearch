Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Lead Data/AI Engineering position at AT&T in Dallas, TX. With a 20+ year career in data engineering and a passion for driving innovation through scalable solutions, I am eager to contribute to AT&T’s mission of connecting people through cutting-edge technology.

As a Senior Data Engineer at CITI since 2017, I have honed my expertise in architecting data pipelines and AI-driven solutions, aligning directly with AT&T’s focus on transforming complex data into actionable insights. My recent project, the Serverless Lakehouse Platform on AWS, utilized S3, Glue, Athena, and Bedrock to design a high-performance data platform, incorporating a Text-to-SQL GenAI agent with Claude 3 Sonnet. This experience in cloud deployment and performance optimization on AWS mirrors the technical requirements of your role. Additionally, my proficiency in Python, SQL, and PySpark—key skills for this position—has enabled me to build automated ETL pipelines ingesting telemetry from over 6,000 endpoints, ensuring data integrity and scalability.

Another flagship project, HorizonScale, an AI Capacity Forecasting Engine, showcases my ability to lead the creation of scalable Data & AI applications. By replacing legacy processes with a parallel generator-based pipeline using Python, Prophet, and PySpark, I reduced forecasting cycles by 90% and delivered real-time insights via interactive Streamlit dashboards. This aligns with AT&T’s emphasis on scalability strategies and software engineering best practices. My extensive experience with cloud platforms like AWS and data engineering technologies positions me to evaluate and select optimal solutions for both cloud and on-premises deployments, as outlined in your responsibilities.

I am thrilled at the opportunity to bring my expertise in data engineering and AI technologies to AT&T, a company with a storied history of innovation since 1885. I am confident that my skills and passion for scalable solutions can contribute to your team’s success. I look forward to discussing how my background aligns with your needs and would welcome the chance to interview at your convenience. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
