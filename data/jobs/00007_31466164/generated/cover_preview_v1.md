Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Data Engineer ID50062 position at Agile Engine. With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and a passion for innovative solutions, I am eager to contribute to your mission of empowering businesses through cutting-edge software and data-driven transformation.

My extensive background aligns closely with Agile Engine’s focus on designing scalable Data Lakes, Warehouses, and Lakehouses. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas, ingesting telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints. Recently, I designed a full serverless data platform using AWS technologies like S3, Glue, and Athena, optimizing ETL processes for enterprise scale with Parquet compression. My expertise in PySpark and Airflow further supports efficient data ingestion and orchestration, ensuring robust ELT processes as outlined in your requirements.

Additionally, I bring deep proficiency in Big Data technologies and cloud platforms like AWS, which are critical for this role. My HorizonScale AI Capacity Forecasting Engine project replaced legacy processes with a parallel generator-based pipeline, reducing forecasting cycles by 90% using Python, PySpark, and Spark. I have also worked extensively with SQL and data warehousing solutions, aligning with your emphasis on Medallion Architecture and columnar file formats. Agile Engine’s commitment to innovation and adaptability resonates with my approach to leveraging cutting-edge tools for advanced analytics and machine learning initiatives.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my skills in Python, AWS, PySpark, and ETL design to Agile Engine, contributing to your remote-first, innovative environment. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience can support your team’s goals in building scalable data solutions. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of an interview.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
