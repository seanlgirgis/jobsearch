# Score Report for 00007.AgileEngine.DataEngineer.1303

## Match Score: 95%
## Recommendation: Strong Proceed
## Strongest Matches
- **Python Expertise**: 15 years of expert-level experience, far exceeding the 5+ years required, with strong hands-on skills in data processing libraries like Pandas and PySpark.
- **ETL/ELT & Big Data**: 15 years of ETL design/optimization and 10+ years in data warehousing, aligning perfectly with designing scalable Data Lakes/Warehouses and ingestion workflows.
- **Cloud & AWS Skills**: Extensive experience with AWS serverless architectures (Glue/Athena), matching the job’s focus on AWS infrastructure and optimization.
- **SQL & Database Knowledge**: 18 years of expert-level SQL/Oracle and advanced knowledge of data architectures, covering the required deep understanding of Medallion Architecture and database technologies.
- **API Integration**: Proven expertise in building automated telemetry pipelines, aligning with the need for third-party API data ingestion.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Limited Airflow Experience**: No explicit mention of Airflow or similar orchestration tools in the profile. *Mitigation*: Highlight any related workflow automation experience (e.g., custom scripting or other tools) and express willingness to quickly upskill in Airflow, leveraging existing Python expertise.
- **Fintech Familiarity**: While recent experience at CITI suggests some financial domain exposure, it’s not explicitly detailed. *Mitigation*: Emphasize transferable skills from CITI and capacity forecasting work, framing them as relevant to fintech challenges.
- **Specific Tools (Terraform, SageMaker, Scala)**: No mention of Terraform, AWS SageMaker Studio, or Scala in the profile. *Mitigation*: Showcase adaptability with similar tools (e.g., AWS infrastructure experience) and a track record of learning new technologies quickly.

## Advice
- Tailor your application to emphasize AWS and Python-based Big Data projects, particularly migrations to serverless architectures and API integrations, as these are core to the role.
- Address the Airflow gap by researching basic concepts and mentioning any analogous orchestration experience in your cover letter or interview.
- Highlight your 20+ years of enterprise experience as a key differentiator, positioning yourself as a mentor-level candidate who can guide technical roadmaps.
- Prepare to discuss how your CITI experience relates to fintech, focusing on data-driven decision-making or forecasting use cases.
- Express enthusiasm for learning Terraform and other “nice-to-have” tools, citing your history of mastering new technologies (e.g., GenAI agents).
