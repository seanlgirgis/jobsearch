Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Capacity Engineer Compute position at Anthropic. With a mission to develop safe and aligned AI systems, Anthropic’s commitment to ethical innovation resonates deeply with my passion for building efficient, impactful infrastructure solutions.

With over 20 years of experience in data engineering and capacity planning, including 15 years specializing in infrastructure forecasting, I bring a proven track record of optimizing cloud infrastructure and driving efficiency. At CITI, as a Senior Capacity & Data Engineer from 2017 to 2025, I architected automated ETL pipelines using Python and Pandas to ingest telemetry data from over 6,000 endpoints, replacing manual processes. I also developed machine learning forecasting models with Prophet and scikit-learn to predict bottlenecks six months ahead, enhancing provisioning accuracy. This aligns directly with Anthropic’s need for automation in capacity planning and expertise in cost analytics.

My recent projects further demonstrate my fit for this role. I designed a serverless lakehouse platform on AWS (Glue, Athena, S3), optimizing ETL processes for enterprise scale, which honed my skills in cloud efficiency optimization and infrastructure management. Additionally, my HorizonScale AI Capacity Forecasting Engine reduced forecasting cycles by 90% through parallel generator-based pipelines and interactive Streamlit dashboards, showcasing my ability to build self-service tools and perform data modeling for cloud environments. With 7 years of AWS experience and a background in budgeting and resource rightsizing at CITI, I am equipped to advise on major expenditure areas and collaborate with cross-functional teams at Anthropic.

I am eager to contribute my expertise in capacity engineering and cloud infrastructure to Anthropic’s mission of safe AI development. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills in automation, forecasting, and cost analytics can support your Compute team’s goals. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your innovative work.

Sincerely,
Sean Luka Girgis
