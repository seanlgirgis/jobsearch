## Gaps & Risks
- **Limited Recent Cloud Vendor Management**: While the candidate has extensive cloud experience, there’s no explicit mention of working with outside vendors for capacity needs, a specific responsibility in the role. *Mitigation*: Highlight any indirect vendor interactions or quickly upskill in vendor management through targeted learning or leveraging existing network.
- **Fast-Paced Environment Adaptation**: The role emphasizes thriving in a fast-paced environment; the candidate’s long tenure in enterprise roles may suggest a preference for structured settings over startup-like agility. *Mitigation*: Emphasize adaptability in past roles (e.g., quick transitions between contracts) and readiness to operate in dynamic settings during interviews.
