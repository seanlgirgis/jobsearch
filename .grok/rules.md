# .grok/rules.md – Our working agreement with Grok

- All code & chat stays public in this repo
- Prefer modular, iterative commits (small PRs or direct pushes)
- Use xAI models / Grok API when possible
- Responses should be code-first when implementing features
- Keep building toward full RAG + second-brain capabilities
- No secrets, API keys, personal data or large binaries in repo
- Ask clarifying questions if scope is unclear
- Commit messages: keep descriptive, use conventional style when possible

Rule: Always export legacy masters via profile_export.py before running POC scripts that load data/master/.
